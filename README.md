# materials-discovery
Semi-supervised learning code + CAVD + BVSE + QE-NEB for identifying prospective ion conductors.

<p><b>Overview: Semi-supervised Learning.</b> The semi-superivsed learning pipeline is split into six sub steps which are documented sequentially in the following notebooks:</p>

1. Step1_Data_Pull_and_Clean.inyb
2. Step2_Labeled_Data.inyb
3. Step3_Feature_Generator.inyb
4. Step4_Feature_Merge.inyb
5. Step5_Agglomerative_Clustering.inyb
6. Step6_Comparing_Models.inyb

<p><b>Overview: CAVD+BVSE+NEB.</b> To expedite Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) calculations in Quantum Espresso, initials pathways were guessed by using Crystal Analysis by Voronoi Decomposition (CAVD) and Bond Valence Site Energy (BVSE) calculations. The notebook working_cavd_bvse_neb.inyb documents the entire process, all the way through performing an NEB calculation in Quantum Espresso. Qualitatively, the following steps are performed:</p>

1. Check that an input structure is ordered. Otherwise order it. 
2. Determine suitable hyperparamters by running self-consistent field (SCF) calculations on the input structure.
    1. kmesh - the k-space mesh.
    1. Ecutwfc - the wavefunction kinetic energy cutoff.
    1. Ecutrho - the charge density and potential kinetic energy cutoff. 
3. With suitable hyperparameters determined, relax the input structure to ~zero pressure.
4. Run the voronoi decomposition algorithm (CAVD) to find void pathways through the structure. 
5. Run the bond valence site energy (BVSE) calculation to estimate the electrostatic force field. 
6. Merge the CAVD and BVSE results to identify low-activation energy pathways. 
7. Select a pathway to examine. 
8. Generate an initial and final image from the pathway, by removing the relevant mobile ion. 
9. Relax the initial and final image to ~zero pressure. 
10. Create intermediate images by combining the CAVD+BVSE results with interpolation:
    1. Framework ions are interpolated between the initial and final images.
    1. Mobile ions are placed along the CAVD+BVSE pathway. 
11. Run & interperet Nudged Elastic Band on the images.

The CAVD and BVSE libraries were originally generated by the Siqi Shi group. The code herein is altered for compability with Quantum Espresso. For VASP compatibility, their repo can be found here: https://gitee.com/shuhebing/cavd/tree/release
